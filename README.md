# Group_BSE24-32 Project

## Project Description
This is a simple yet comprehensive project designed to demonstrate and implement best practices for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and production-level monitoring. The project provides a full-stack web application that simulates a real-world scenario, incorporating **Django** for the backend and frontend setup using **Bootstrap**, **jQuery**, **Popper.js**, **Sass**, and **Webpack** with Loaders.

The main objective of this project is to enable developers and DevOps teams to understand and practice the key aspects of software delivery pipelines on a web application, including:

1. **Setting Up Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automating the testing and integration of code through CI tools.
2. **Continuous Deployment to Staging**: Deploying to a staging environment for testing and verification before production.
3. **Production Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploying the application to production and monitoring performance, security, and uptime.
